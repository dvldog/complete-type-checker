	The Type_Checker program was compiled using the Eclipse platform.  Accompanying the program is an input file called "Input_1.txt" and "Input_2.txt". "Input_1.txt" will contains several variations of valid functions that will be evaluated and "Input_2.txt" will contain functions with errors.  The results will be printed to an output file called "Out_Put.txt" and. The "Main" class consists of two String arguments that are the input and output files.  Those two Strings are passed as arguments to the "setInStream" method of the "Type_Checker" class.  A while loop then returns a single token from the input file through each iteration until the end of file is reached.  The tokens are stored in an array class of "Tokens" objects that contains the string and the token state.  Once the end of file is reached, a linearly indented parse tree is constructed.  The TypeEval() method is applied to the parse tree for <fun def list> and the results are printed immediately after the parse tree is displayed.  Once the parse tree and type checking results are displayed, the input and output files are closed.
	To run this program, the main method is in the "Type_Checker" class.  The user MUST specify the location of the input and output files and compile the program from there.  I have included two sample text files which are called "Input.txt" and "Out_Put.txt". "Input.txt can be used as a sample input file for the program and "Out_put.txt" is the file where the results will be printed.
